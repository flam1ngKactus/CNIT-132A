It's a bit like a twisted reality show, isn't it? You walk into an open house, and the realtor, with a smile that could sell ice to an Eskimo, describes a "cozy" 500-square-foot shoebox as "charming" and "intimate." The kitchen, they'll have you believe, is a "chef's delight," despite the fact that only a chef who specializes in single-serving microwave meals could actually work in there. And the price? Oh, the price! It's a number so astronomical, you'd think the house came with its own moon colony. You start to wonder if these sellers are deliberately trying to make potential buyers question their life choices, their career paths, and possibly their entire existence. You put in an offer, naturally, because that's what we masochists do, only to be told you're competing with twenty other offers, all significantly above asking, from people who apparently found their fortune in a lucky lottery ticket or perhaps by discovering a hidden treasure chest in their attic.<p>Then comes the inspection, a process that reveals the "character" of the house. That character, it turns out, includes a family of squirrels living in the attic, a plumbing system held together by what appears to be ancient chewing gum, and a foundation that's more "leaning tower of Pisa" than "solid ground." The inspector, with a grim face, delivers the news, and you realize that "fixer-upper" was the understatement of the century. You briefly consider taking up a nomadic lifestyle, living in a tent, and befriending the local wildlife, because, at this point, it seems like a more financially sound and emotionally stable option. But alas, the siren song of homeownership, however delusional, keeps you in the game, ready to face the next round of bidding wars and structural surprises, all while wondering if you'll ever own a home that doesn't require a small loan from the International Monetary Fund and a team of engineers.</div>
